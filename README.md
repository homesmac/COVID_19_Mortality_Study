# COVID-19 Mortality Study

# Purpose
This is simply an exploratory data analysis project into the true mortality of the COVID-19 virus, in the United States, using the latest and most comprehensive data available from the CDC.

# Key Findings
While I am far from qualified to postulate on anything remotely virology related, I found it interesting that the mortality rate is far from static. While a generally distrubited vaccine has yet to be delivered, the mortality rate decreases month over month, from the onset of the virus to present day. I assume this is due to a number of factors, namely the increase of testing, a better understanding of the virus, and medical advances in treatment.

# Parameters used in the "White, Non-Hispanic, Male, 70-79 years old" analysis:
* Race and ethnicity (combined) = 'White, Non-Hispanic'
* Sex = 'Male'
* Age_group = '70 -79 Years'
* Death_yn = 'Yes'
* Current_status = 'Laboratory-confirmed case'

# Ambiguities:
* 42.30% race is 'Unknown'
* 0.15% sex is 'Missing' or 'Other'
* 0.11% age_group is 'Unknown'
* 50.64% death_yn is 'Missing' or 'Unknown'
* 3.53% current_status is 'Probable Case'



# Next Steps
Incorporate comorbidity data also available from CDC, however a hurdle remains as the data is not split by demographics available in this study.
