# COVID-19 Mortality Study

# Purpose
This is an exploratory data analysis project into the mortality rate of COVID-19, in the United States, using the latest data available from the CDC.

# Key Findings
While I am far from qualified to postulate on anything remotely virology related, I found it interesting that the mortality rate is far from static over time. While a generally distrubited vaccine has yet to be available, the observed mortality rate has generally decreased across all age groups on a month over month basis.

# Ambiguities:
* 42.30% race is 'Unknown'
* 0.15% sex is 'Missing' or 'Other'
* 0.11% age_group is 'Unknown'
* 50.64% death_yn is 'Missing' or 'Unknown'
* 3.53% current_status is 'Probable Case'

# Next Steps
Incorporate comorbidity data also available from CDC, however a hurdle remains as the data is not split by demographics available in this study.
