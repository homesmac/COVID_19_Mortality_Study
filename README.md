# COVID-19 Mortality Study

# Purpose
This is an exploratory data analysis project into the mortality rate of COVID-19, in the United States, using the latest data available from the CDC.

# Key Findings
While I am far from a qualified virologist to postulate on anything remotely virology related, I found it interesting that the mortality rate is far from static over time. While a generally distributed vaccine has yet to be available, the observed mortality rate has generally decreased across all age groups on a month over month basis. No hypothesis testing for causality has occurred in this EDA.

# Mortality (%) for all sex, race and ethnicity, grouped by age:

# Ambiguities:
* 42.30% race is 'Unknown'
* 0.15% sex is 'Missing' or 'Other'
* 0.11% age_group is 'Unknown'
* 50.64% death_yn is 'Missing' or 'Unknown'
* 3.53% current_status is 'Probable Case'

# Next Steps
Incorporate comorbidity data also available from the CDC. However, this data is not split by demographic which may pose a challenge.
